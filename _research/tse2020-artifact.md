Software systems evolve throughout their life cycles. Many revisions are produced over time. Verifying each revision of the software is impractical. Regression veriﬁcation suggests reusing intermediate results from the previous veriﬁcation runs. This paper studies regression veriﬁcation via summary reuse. Not only procedure summaries, but also loop summaries are proposed to be reused. This paper proposes a fully automatic regression veriﬁcation technique in the context of CEGAR. A lazy counterexample analysis technique is developed to improve the efﬁciency of summary reuse. We performed extensive experiments on two large sets of industrial programs (3,675 revisions of 488 Linux kernel device drivers). Results show that our summary reuse technique saves 84% to 93% analysis time of the regression veriﬁcation.
