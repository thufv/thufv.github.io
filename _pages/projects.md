## AutoMerge

[AutoMerge](https://thufv.github.io/automerge/) aims to resolve merge conflicts that cannot be resolved by existing structured merge approaches. It is built on the top of JDime, a state-of-the-art structured merger. It employs the power of version space algebra and the basic rules of three-way merge.
